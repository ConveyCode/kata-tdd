# Numbers in words

## Problem Description

It occurs now and then in real life that people want to write about money, especially about a certain amount of money.

If it comes to cheques or contracts for example some nations have laws that state that you should write out the amount in words additionally to the amount in numbers to avoid fraud and mistakes.

So if you want to transfer 745 $ to someone via cheque you have to fill out two fields:

745.00 $ (amount in numbers) must result into:

> seven hundred forty-five dollars (amount in words)

## Time to code

Implement the following rules following the great TDD principles (with baby steps of course).

- Write a little converter class or function (depends on your favourite language and flavour) to convert numbers into words.
    - minimum number is 0 (zero)
    - maximum number is 1,000,000 (one million)
- Write a converter class of function which converts back the text number into the good number.
